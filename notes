1)Variables
Assignment not allowed outside function for var
every varible declared must be used or replaced by _

2)Zero values
Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.

The zero value is:

0 for numeric types,
false for the boolean type, and
"" (the empty string) for strings.

3)Value & Reference types
Value Types 
int,bool,struct,float,string
Reference Types ( where the type points to a struct containing [pointer to actual data] and [some values like capacity,length,etc] )
slices,maps,channels,pointers,functions :> Here the value passed contains pointer

4)Maps Vs Structs

Maps : Reference Type , Keys of same type, Values of same type, dynamic , indexed , collection of related props, 'comma' after every pair in declaration
Structs : Value Type , Collection of diff props

5)A concrete type is a data type that is not an interface
